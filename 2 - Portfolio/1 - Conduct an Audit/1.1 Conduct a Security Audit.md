# Controls and Compliance Assessment

## Does Botium Toys currently have this control in place?

---

# Case Study

### This is based on a fictional company: 

**Botium Toys** is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as its main office, storefront, and warehouse for its products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, its information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support its online market worldwide.

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

The IT manager starts by implementing the **National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)**, establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The audit's goal is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of its security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, an internal audit will be performed by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

# Scenario

## Botium Toys: Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report

### Establishing the Scope of the Audit
Scope refers to the specific criteria of an internal security audit. The audit will cover the entire security program at Botium Toys. This refers to individuals, assets, policies, and procedures that may affect the security posture of Botium Toys.

### Goals
- Ensuring business continuity by adhering to regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for EU citizens and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).  
- Identifying and diminishing threats, risks, and vulnerabilities by implementing appropriate security controls. 

---

## Current Assets
Assets managed by the IT Department include:

- **On-premises equipment** for in-office business needs.
- **Employee equipment**: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
- **Storefront products**: Available for retail sale on-site and online; stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse.
- **Management of systems, software, and services**: Accounting, telecommunication, database, security, e-commerce, and inventory management.
- **Internet access.**
- **Internal network.**
- **Data retention and storage.**
- **Legacy system maintenance**: End-of-life systems that require human monitoring.

## Risk Assessments

### Risk Description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

### Control Best Practices
The first of the five functions of the **NIST CSF** is **Identify**. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

### Risk Score
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is **8**, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.

### Additional Comments
- The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as **medium** because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk.
- The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is rated as **high** because Botium Toys does not have the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to compliance regulations.

## Control Categories
Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:

1. **Administrative/Managerial controls**: Address the human component of cybersecurity.  
2. **Technical controls**: Include solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc.  
3. **Physical/Operational controls**: Limit physical access to physical assets by unauthorized personnel.

---

## Control Types
Control types include, but are not limited to:

1. **Preventative**: Preventative controls are designed to prevent an incident from occurring in the first place.  
2. **Corrective**: Corrective controls are used to restore an asset after an incident..  
3. **Detective**:  Detective controls are implemented to determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress.  
4. **Deterrent**: Deterrent controls are designed to discourage attacks.

These controls work together to provide **defense in depth** and protect assets.

### Recommendations

Several controls need to be implemented to ensure the confidentiality of customers' data (SPII/PII). These principles could include:

- **Encryption** to ensure that data is only accessible to authorized users.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Employees are strictly provided with the exact resources they need to perform a task.
- **Separation of Duties**: Prevent employees from having multiple privileges in the organization.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to alert any malicious behavior.
- **Password Policies** to outline guidelines for a robust password.
- **Password Management Systems** to store passwords in case of any password issues.
- **Backups** to ensure business continuity in case of any breach.
- **Daily Maintenance of Legacy Systems** to receive regular updates and patches to prevent them from being vulnerable.

These practices will improve the security posture of the organization.

To address gaps in compliance, Botium Toys needs to adhere to international regulations and laws by keeping customer data safe through encryption. Other practices such as separation of duties, keeping E.U. data secure, and ensuring that data is properly classified will help identify controls needed to improve the security posture of the organization and protect its critical assets.
