  # Jeff's cybersecurity journey.
**professional summary**

As an Information Technology student with three years of experience in core security technologies, I aim to safeguard systems and networks from threat actors by ensuring robust security mechanisms are in place.

Currently, I'm enrolled in Google's cybersecurity certificate program which is preparing me for CompTIA Sec+ certification. The course covered key topics such as `Information Security`, `Compliance and ethics in cybersecurity`,
`Security Audits`, `The bits and bytes of computer networking and network security`, `Linux & SQL`, `Assets, threats & vulnerabilities`, `SIEM tools`, and `Python`. I believe this course is a stepping stone for me as I aim to 
progress while learning. 

As I continue to deepen my knowledge and practical skills, I remain committed to developing a strong foundation in the core areas of cybersecurity, including risk management, encryption, ethical hacking, and network security.
This portfolio reflects the skills I have acquired so far. I will keep updating it as I pace forward. 

Thank you for visiting and I hope this journey inspires you as it motivates me.
