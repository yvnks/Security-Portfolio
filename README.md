**Professional Statement**

If you are reading this, it means you came across my portfolio, I hope you find my journey inspiring. 
My name is Jefferson Joojo Yankson. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in Ghana, with a major in Computer Security.
I am driven towards Safeguarding Systems And Networks.

In information technology, I see a purposeful and versatile vocation yet cybersecurity is what I love most. Last year, I read about recent digital attacks and how they've impacted 
the digital world. I came across the Equifax breach. Due to the lack of secured systems, Personally Identifiable Information known as PII and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information known as SPII were leaked. 
The breach highlighted the need for robust mechanisms to safeguard both individual privacy and organizational integrity.

As I continue to deepen my knowledge and practical skills, I remain committed to developing a strong foundation in the core areas of cybersecurity, including risk management, encryption, ethical hacking, and network security.
This portfolio reflects the skills I have acquired so far. I will keep updating it as I pace forward. 

Thank you for visiting and i hope this journey inspires you as it motivates me.
